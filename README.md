## Technology and technique utilized

The project required installing, setting up Express project, and creating an
Express server in the project root to serve as an entry point. The Express Server was configured to run on port 3001.

Utilized linter to find errors and maintian code consistency.

Installed nodemon package as a dev dependency to ensure the server restart when the project files change. The application is launched with a hot reload when running the npm run dev command.

Installed MongoDB to ensure initilization of the database that store the user and clothing item data.

Utilized Postman to create a test user to check the project; GitHub was also used for this process

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
